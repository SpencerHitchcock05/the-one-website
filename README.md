This is personal project for a webpage that acts as an interactive map of Middle Earth from The Lord of the Rings. I made this as a passion project after I had 
finished the The Lord Of The Rings books and had the idea to make a wiki-type website but with something more interesting

I do not own any of the text generated it is all from the Lord of the Rings fandom page
https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page

any images from searched queries are accessed from tolkien gateway
